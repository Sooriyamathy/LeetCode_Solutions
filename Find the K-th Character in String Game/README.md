# 3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I

## Problem Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`.

You are given a positive integer `k`.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

- Generate a new string by changing each character in `word` to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
    - For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

The goal is to return the value of the k-th character in `word`, after enough operations have been done for `word` to have at least `k` characters.

Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.

## Example

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```python
k = 5
```

**Output:**
```python
"b"
```

**Explanation:**
Initially, `word = "a"`. We need to do the operation three times:

- Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
- Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
- Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".

The 5th character in the final string is "b".

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```python
k = 10
```

**Output:**
```python
"c"
```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= k <= 500`

## Approach

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - Initially, Alice starts with the string `word = "a"`.
   - After each operation, the length of the string increases as the string expands by appending the "next character" version of the current string.
   - The string grows exponentially in length, so it is important to track the length and focus on efficiently finding the k-th character without explicitly constructing the full string.

2. **Strategy:**
   - Keep track of the stringâ€™s length as it grows.
   - For each iteration, calculate the new length and stop when the length exceeds `k`.
   - By using modular arithmetic and understanding the pattern of string growth, directly compute the k-th character.

## Solution

You can implement the solution by simulating the growth of the string or using a mathematical approach to find the k-th character directly without building the entire string.

```python
def findKthCharacter(k: int) -> str:
    # The initial string is "a"
    current_length = 1  # The length of the initial string "a"
    current_char = 'a'  # Start with 'a'
    
    # Continue expanding until the length is greater than or equal to k
    while current_length < k:
        current_length = 2 * current_length  # The string doubles in size each time
    
    # Find the character corresponding to the k-th position
    index = k - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
    while current_length > 1:
        mid = current_length // 2
        if index >= mid:
            # If the index is in the second half, adjust the index and continue
            index -= mid
        current_length = mid
    
    # Return the character at the final index
    return chr((ord(current_char) + index - ord('a')) % 26 + ord('a'))
```

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently calculates the k-th character in the growing string sequence by simulating the growth process without generating the entire sequence. This solution works within the problem's constraints and avoids unnecessary memory usage.
